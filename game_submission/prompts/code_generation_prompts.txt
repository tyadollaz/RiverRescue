# Prompts for Code Generation

1. **Game Logic Development**
   - What are the core mechanics of the game that need to be implemented in code?
   - How can I structure the game loop to ensure smooth gameplay?
   - What data structures will be necessary to manage game state and player interactions?

2. **User Interface Components**
   - What UI elements are required for the main menu, and how should they be organized?
   - How can I create responsive design elements that adapt to different screen sizes?
   - What event listeners are needed to handle user input effectively?

3. **Integration of Assets**
   - How can I load and manage game assets (images, audio) efficiently in the code?
   - What methods can be used to preload assets to minimize loading times during gameplay?

4. **Game State Management**
   - How will I manage transitions between different game states (menu, playing, results)?
   - What strategies can I use to save and load game progress?

5. **Debugging and Testing**
   - What are the best practices for debugging game logic and ensuring code quality?
   - How can I implement logging to track game events and errors during development?
