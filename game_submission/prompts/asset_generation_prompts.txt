# Prompts for Asset Generation

1. Could you please help me generate a pixelart background of the Mekong Delta preferably 960 x 540 pixels. I want the aesthetic to be simple and cute and pixelated just like the image i will provide you as reference. The river should be slightly murky and the skyline to be slightly orangey. 
Could you also provide another background with the exact image, but change the color of the river to be less murky and more bluish
2. Could you please help me generate a pixelart image of the following items: boat, plastic bottle, crushed soda can, submarine, log, fish net, magnet, shield and timer.
3. Could you help me resize these images to make it smaller about 24 pixels
