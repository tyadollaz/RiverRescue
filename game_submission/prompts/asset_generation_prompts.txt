# Prompts for Asset Generation

## Background Images

1. Could you please help me generate a pixelart background of the Mekong Delta preferably 960 x 540 pixels. I want the aesthetic to be simple and cute and pixelated just like the image I will provide you as reference. The river should be slightly murky and the skyline to be slightly orangey, representing pollution and early morning/evening light.

2. Could you also provide another background with the exact same composition, but change the color of the river to be less murky and more bluish, representing a cleaner state of the river?

3. Create 7 progressive versions of the river background:
   - Stage 0: Very murky brown water, dark pollution clouds
   - Stage 1: Dark brown water, some visibility
   - Stage 2: Brown-green water transitioning
   - Stage 3: Green-blue water, clearer
   - Stage 4: Light blue water, much cleaner
   - Stage 5: Clear blue water, beautiful
   - Stage 6: Crystal clear blue water, pristine condition
   
   Keep the same Saigon/Mekong River skyline with buildings and landmarks, only change water color and sky brightness.

## Sprite Assets - Collectibles

4. Could you please help me generate pixelart images of the following trash items (32x32 pixels):
   - Plastic water bottle (clear with blue cap)
   - Crushed aluminum soda can (red/silver)
   - Plastic shopping bag (white/beige)
   
   Make them recognizable but cute, simple pixel art style

5. Generate the sprites with transparency (PNG format) so they work well against any background

## Sprite Assets - Obstacles

6. Create pixelart sprites for obstacles (48x48 pixels):
   - Wooden log floating in water (brown, bark texture)
   - Abandoned fishing net (tangled, ghostly look)
   - Small submarine/underwater debris (industrial, rusty)
   
   These should look slightly more threatening than collectibles

## Sprite Assets - Power-ups

7. Generate pixelart power-up sprites (40x40 pixels) with glowing/special effects:
   - Magnet icon (horseshoe magnet, red and blue)
   - Shield icon (eco-friendly green shield)
   - Timer/clock icon (clock with green plus symbol)
   
   Add subtle glow or sparkle effects to make them stand out as special items

## Player Sprite

8. Create a pixelart boat sprite (64x48 pixels):
   - Small eco-volunteer boat
   - Vietnamese style fishing/patrol boat
   - Friendly, clean design
   - Facing right (direction of travel)
   - Could show "River Rescue" text on side

## Resizing and Optimization

9. Could you help me resize these images to make them smaller, about 24-48 pixels depending on importance:
   - Boat: 48px wide
   - Trash: 24-32px
   - Obstacles: 40-48px
   - Power-ups: 32-40px

10. Optimize all PNG files for web:
    - Reduce color palette where possible
    - Compress without losing quality
    - Ensure transparency is preserved
    - Target file size under 10KB per sprite

## Icon and UI Elements

11. Generate small UI icons (16x16 pixels):
    - Score star/gem
    - Timer clock
    - Trash counter icon
    - Menu button
    - Play/pause buttons

12. Create simple text/button backgrounds:
    - Menu button backgrounds (rounded rectangles)
    - Score display panel
    - Timer display background
    
## Style Guidelines Reference

13. All assets should follow these style guidelines:
    - Pixel art aesthetic (not high-res scaled down)
    - Limited color palette (8-16 colors per sprite)
    - Clean, readable silhouettes
    - Consistent lighting direction (top-left)
    - Cute/friendly not realistic
    - Vietnamese cultural elements where appropriate

14. For the AI image generator, use prompts like:
    "pixel art, 32x32, simple, cute, [item name], transparent background, retro game style, clean pixels, limited colors"

15. Request variations:
    "Generate 3 variations of [item] so I can choose the best one for game readability"
