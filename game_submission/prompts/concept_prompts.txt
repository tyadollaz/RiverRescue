# Brainstorming prompts for game concept development

## Initial Concept Phase

1. I want to create a game with similar gameplay/engagement like the game 'Jetpack Joyride', could you validate this game with the following requirements: 
   - Relates to a social issue: environmental friendliness
   - Your game must include at least the following screens/views: Menu, Play, End
   - The game should be educational but fun and engaging

2. I must use the following framework to code: HTML, CSS, Javascript. What is the recommended game engine framework to use for the scrolling side-scroller arcade game? Should I use Phaser, PixiJS, or vanilla canvas?

3. Help me generate the 2-3 lines of backstory of this game related to Mekong Delta and Vietnamese rivers. The game should focus on pollution and cleaning efforts.

4. What game mechanics would work well for an environmental cleanup game? Consider:
   - Collection mechanics (trash pickup)
   - Obstacles (pollution sources)
   - Power-ups (cleanup tools)
   - Progression system (river cleanliness stages)

5. How can we make the environmental message clear without being preachy? What visual feedback can show the player's positive impact?

## Game Design Refinement

6. Create a list of 8-10 game elements (collectibles, obstacles, power-ups) that represent:
   - Real pollution types in Vietnamese rivers
   - Environmental threats
   - Cleanup technologies
   - Each element should have symbolic meaning

7. What scoring system would encourage learning about different types of waste? Should plastic bags be worth more than bottles? Why?

8. How should the game balance difficulty with educational value? Should it get harder as the river gets cleaner?

9. Design a progression system that shows environmental impact:
   - How many stages of cleanliness?
   - What visual changes show improvement?
   - How do we celebrate player achievements?

## Technical Approach

10. Should this be built with React + Phaser for better structure, or pure JavaScript for simplicity? Consider:
    - Maintainability
    - Performance
    - Asset management
    - State management

11. What's the best way to handle responsive design for a game that needs precise controls?

12. How should we persist player progress? LocalStorage for high scores? What data matters most?

## Educational Content

13. What facts about river pollution in Vietnam should be included in the game?
    - Statistics on plastic waste
    - Impact on marine life
    - Mekong River importance
    - Community cleanup efforts

14. Where should educational content appear without disrupting gameplay?
    - Loading screens
    - End screen
    - Menu "About" section
    - Pause screen

15. How can we inspire real-world action through the game? What call-to-action should we include?
