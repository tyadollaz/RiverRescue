**🕹️ Gameplay Overview

🌱 Educational Message

“River Rescue” isn’t just a game — it’s an interactive metaphor for sustainability.

Every piece of trash you collect reflects real-world actions — from beach cleanups to policy advocacy.

The Mekong River is a lifeline for millions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Its health represents the interconnectedness of ecology, economy, and community.

Players experience firsthand that small, consistent actions — like proper waste disposal or reducing single-use plastics — can lead to visible change.
